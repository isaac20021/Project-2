## Hangman Game
## This code creates a hangman game that allows a user to input a guess 10 times to guess the correct word. Once the correct word is guessed, the decrypt function is used to decrypt the word and find its ascii value and provide that to the user once the correct word is guessed. If the word is not guessed after ten tries, the user loses the game.
